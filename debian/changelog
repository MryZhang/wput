wput (0.6-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fix double-build FTBFS (Closes: #442765) by tweaking debian/rules:
    - Call "$(MAKE) clean" rather than "$(MAKE) distclean" since the
      latter doesn't exist.
    - Don't ignore "$(MAKE) clean" errors anymore, by checking for the
      presence of a Makefile.
    - Do not remove config.status since it's needed for the "clean" run
      in po/Makefile.
    - Remove doc/wput.1.gz through dh_clean.
    - Based on a patch by Kartik Mistry.
  * Move the config.{guess,sub} update to the config.status target, remove
    them in the clean target, they are now kept out of the Debian diff.
  * Use dh_install on wput and doc/wput.1, remove now useless gzip call,
    as well as useless (commented) dh_* calls.
  * Delete debian/dirs, no longer needed now that dh_install is used.
  * Move the Homepage from the description to a source field.
  * Bump Standards-Version from 3.7.2 to 3.7.3, no changes needed.
